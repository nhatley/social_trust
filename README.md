Source: Idea behind this project is to estimate trends in trust and what is correlated with them. Idea came from this twitter thread from Noah Smith as a retort to Douthat's nyt piece about immigration.

Goal: make interactive plots of the trust battery from GSS of American's trust in society cut by different subgroups. 

Progress: I have ran all the weighted estimates from 72-16.

Work left: Settle on a suitable way of displaying the output. Most likely a shiny page, but need to setup a master site with hugo/github that should link to this portion.
